# Polymer Shop Clone

This project is a clone of the [Polymer Shop website](https://shop.polymer-project.org/), designed to replicate the core layout and functionality of the original site. The goal of this project was to create a 5-page e-commerce website using a **mobile-first approach**.

## Pages in the Clone
1. **Home Page** - Serves as the landing page with featured items and key navigation links.
2. **Item Listing Page** - Displays all available products, organized and styled similarly to the original shop.
3. **Single Item Page** - Provides details for a selected item, including a description, price, and an option to add to the cart.
4. **Cart Page** - Showcases items added to the cart (hard-coded for demonstration purposes).
5. **Checkout Page** - A placeholder for the final step in the purchase process.

## Key Points

### Mobile-First Approach
The project was built with a mobile-first mindset. This means that all styles and layouts were first developed for mobile screens and then scaled up to larger screens using responsive design principles.

### Code Structure
- **README.md** and **.gitignore** files are included in the repository.
- A common **styles.css** file was created to streamline styles across all pages. This CSS file is included on each HTML page, and style classes are reused wherever possible.

### Development Approach
1. **Modular Design**: Development was done page by page, section by section, breaking down each page into smaller components and styling them individually.
2. **Iterative Process**: The website was built element by element to keep the development organized and manageable.
3. **Problem-Solving**: At each step, unknowns were addressed through research and problem-solving to better understand each aspect of the design and functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling and implementing a responsive, mobile-first layout.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and handling user input.



## Future Enhancements
- Adding real dynamic data to the cart page.
- Implementing JavaScript for a fully functional checkout process.
- Optimizing styles for better performance on various devices.
